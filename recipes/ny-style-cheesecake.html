        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F and prepare a 9 inch springform pan. Lightly coat the entire
                inside with cooking spray. Cover the bottom with parchment paper and press two strips
                (or as many as is takes to cover the walls) of parchment paper up against the sides.
                They should peak over top of the pan just a little.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs (finely ground in a food processor),
                 sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Then stir in the melted butter until you get the texture of wet sand.</li>
            <li>Pour into the pan and press it down into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. It should almost
                reach the top. You can use a small measuring cup or a ladle to pack it in.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10</li>
        </ol>
