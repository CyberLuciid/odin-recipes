        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F and prepare a 9 inch springform pan. Lightly coat the entire
                inside with cooking spray. Cover the bottom with parchment paper and press two strips
                (or as many as is takes to cover the walls) of parchment paper up against the sides.
                They should peak over top of the pan just a little.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs (finely ground in a food processor),
                 sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Then stir in the melted butter until you get the texture of wet sand.</li>
            <li>Pour into the pan and press it down into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. It should almost
                reach the top. You can use a small measuring cup or a ladle to pack it in.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 minutes then set it out to cool while you prep the cheesecake.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>New York Cheesecake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Drop the oven temperature to 305F (yes, 305!) and place a large baking pan on the very bottom rack
                of your oven, like a roast pan. While you prepare the cheesecake, get a medium sized pot of water 
                boiling over the stove. You'll pour this into the baking pan once you're ready to bake.</li>
            <li>Before you start, make sure your cream cheese and eggs are at room temp. <strong>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!</strong>
                If you forgot to leave them out or are feeling a bit impatient (hard not to be with this recipe)
                you can fill a bowl with warm water and let the cream cheese or eggs sit in there for about 20 minutes.
                If you need to bring up the temperature of both, make sure to place them in separate bowls.</li>
            <li>For best results, I recommend using a stand mixer. A hand mixer is also an option, but be very careful
                and only work on low speed.</li>
            <li>In a 2 cup measuring glass, beat together the eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla with a fork. Set aside.</li>
            <li>With the paddle attachment, mix the cream cheese on medium-low speed just until it's smooth (30 sec to 1 min).
                Add in the sugar and cornstarch and mix on low for about 30 seconds to combine.</li>
            <li>Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl, then mix again on low speed for about 30 seconds to smooth out.</li>
            <li>With the mixer on the lowest setting, slowly add in the egg mixture. It should take 3 to 4 hours and PATIENCE. 
                You'll be tempted to bump up the speed but don't do it!</li>
            <li>Take the bowl off the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in the sour cream.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the pan and tap it against your counter a couple times to bring up any air bubbles that might
                have been caught in there.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the boiling water from the stovetop into the pan on the bottom rack and place the cheesecake on
                the middle rack just above it. Move quickly to trap in that steam!</li>
            <li>Bake for 1 hour and 40 minutes. It's done when the edges are golden and the center jiggles when the pan is nudged. 
                Once it's done, leave the cheesecake in the oven, turn off the oven, and crack the door open. Let it sit in there for an hour.</li>
            <li>After the hour is up, put the cheesecake in the fridge uncovered and let it chill overnight. The next day, remove from 
                the pan, slice, and top with powdered sugar, homemade raspberry compote, or leave it as is. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Raspberry Compote</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan.</li>
            <li>Place over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer, stirring regularly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 8-10 minutes or until the raspberries soften and the liquid reduces slightly.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or cool and refrigerate before serving.</li>
        </ol>
