            or you want fill your stomach to the brim with them, they're perfect for any occasion!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>10 fresh jalapenos</li>
            <li>1 1/4 Cups (150g) your choice of breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons garlic powder, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup (120g) cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 to 2/3 Cup finely grated cheddar or Monterrey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>Handful of finely sliced chives/green onions</li>
            <li>1 Cup (130g) plain flour/ all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Approx. 7oz of cold water (200ml)</li>
            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Be sure to wear gloves when handling hot peppers. Remove the stem from the jalapenos and cut longways. 
                Then, remove the veins and seeds either with a knife or by hand.</li>
            <li>If using panko breadcrumbs, make them finer in a food processor. Panko tends to provide a crispier and
                 lighter coating than other types of breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Transfer the breadcrumbs to a large bowl and add salt, garlic powder, and dried parsley. Mix it well.</li>
            <li>In another bowl combine the cream cheese, grated cheese, garlic powder, salt and chives/spring onion greens.
                 Give that a good mix as well, this will be the filling for the jalapenos.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl whisk together the plain flour/all-purpose flour and cold water to form a paste, a few small
                 lumps are absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>Take a heaped spoonful of the cream cheese filling and spoon it into each jalapeno half. Then remove any excess
                 until the filling inside the jalapeno halves are level. Repeat this process for all the jalapenos.</li>
            <li>Now dunk each jalapeno into the flour and water paste. I find this easiest to do with a fork as you can lift the
                 jalapeno to remove excess paste. Then immediately dunk into the breadcrumbs and toss to coat evenly. Transfer
                 the coated jalapenos to a wire rack and allow to sit for around 5-10 minutes. Repeat this step for all the
                 jalapeno halves and allow them all to sit for 5-10 minutes on a wire rack before doing a second coat of breadcrumbs.
                 This allows the first coating to 'set' and secure the filling.</li>
            <li>After all the jalapenos have had their first layer of breadcrumb coating and have had 5-10 minutes to set.
                 Go back and repeat the dunking process in the flour and water paste and the breadcrumbs for a second coating.</li>
            <li>Allow them all to sit for another 5-10 mins. This process of double battering will prevent the cream cheese and
                 cheese filling from bursting whilst frying.</li>
            <li>Deep fry in 180'C oil in small batches, these should take no more than 2 minutes to fry. And voila!</li>
        </ol>
